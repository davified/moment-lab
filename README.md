# Moment Lab

**It's time (pun intended) to learn!**

This assignment requires you to complete a series of time manipulation tasks using `moment.js`, a library that most of you probably haven't encountered before.

### Getting Started
- Fork this repo
- `git clone <repo-url>` 
- `cd` into directory
- Run `npm -v` to check if npm is installed
- `npm install`

### Instructions

Complete the tasks listed in `index.js`. Don't forget to refer to the [docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/). (hint: answers are all in the docs!)
